# DOP_Calculator_DIploma
This is my first project for my portfolio.

This program will be improved and expanded.

Please share the results of the application, bugs and errors, thank you in advance.

The application language is Russian

The main role of this application is to calculate the DOP value (deterioration of communication quality).

#Brief Instructions for use

To run the program, you need to download the application itself. DOP_Calculator.exe

At startup, the main program window will appear with fields and buttons for interaction.

The topmost row contains buttons named "Example", "Restart application", "Update", "Save schedule" and "Help".

The Help button contains basic information on how to use the application.

The "Example" button shows how to enter data into the available fields.

At the moment, the application is working correctly at 2k resolution, I'm still optimizing for any resolution.
